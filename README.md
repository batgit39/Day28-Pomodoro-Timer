# Day28-Pomodoro-Timer
This is a simple pomodoro timer made in python with the turtle module.
Once you press start a work session is started, which lasts for 25 minutes, once that is finishes you get a short break of 5 minutes. After 4 successful cycles of work and short break (1h55m) you get a big break of 20 min. And the whole thing restarts.
